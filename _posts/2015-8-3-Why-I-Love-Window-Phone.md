Everyday someone asks my why I use **Windows Phone** devices, when I have other "better" alternatives like Android or iPhone. I will point out some of the great things that Windows Phone devices have,
maybe I can even convince someone to start using it :)



Couple of things that I like about it **Windows Phone 8**:

* First of all, you can get a really good cellphone without paying too much.
* I love the Metro layout, it feels really natural to me.
* All interactions are really **fluid and smooth**, even if you have a low end device.
* The Start Screen is always showing you something new, it isn't boring at all.

* When you go to a contact, you can see a resume of all his social interactions (Facebook, Twitter...)
    * Don't need to enter in Facebook to post something on a friend.
* I can Pin to the Start Screen almost anything, even websites that I like.
* If you have a Nokia device, you're lucky because you have an excellent Lens (**Carl Zeiss**) and you take awesome photos.
* **Onedrive** gives you an good integration with your phone
    * Photos, Music, Videos, Backups, Office Documents
* You have **offline music** just by saving it on Onedrive, **MixRadio** is a really good Music App, let's you create a Mix and save it offline.
* **Cortana** has really cool features, but maybe not the best personal assistant yet.

* Not the best **Notification Center** but it has evolved since the beginning.
* Excellent apps for GPS, **Here Drive +** gives you updated maps, **offline maps**, I could almost say that it's the best in the market at this moment.
* If you have a Kid always messing with your phone, you have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=475jxWQ955c)">**Kids Corner**</a>.
* The **Keyboard** is really easy to use and it adapts to you really fast.

Some **disadvantages** of using it:

* The market it not as good as the Android Market or App Store
    * I don't feel like being a bad thing because it doesn't have too much garbage, but most of the times the other markets have all the games and apps first.
* Internet Explorer isn't the best browser obviously :(
* If you are a developer and you want to win easy money with mobile apps, Windows Phone shouldn't be your focus.


Now, **Windows Phone 10**

* The Start Screen doesn't have too many changes, but it looks prettier.
* **Notification Center** has evolved a lot, maybe one of the best features so far.
* When I receive a message I can reply without entering the message app.

* Better transitions between menus.
* A list of new installed app is shown right on top.
* The **Keyboard** is even smoother and it has a virtual stick.

* All **Office apps** look really cool
    * The **Outlook** is the best so far but we still have Word, PowerPoint and Excel.
* Settings Menu is well organized.

* **Microsoft Edge**, at this moment is really fast, I hope it continues this way :)
* The Messaging app is a lot better, you can send this directly
    * Photo or Video
    * Use your Camera
    * **Your Location** this is my favorite, it will send my location to my friend and it will automatically load the **Here Drive +** (or your default Navigation app) to show the route.
    * Contact
    * Voice note
    * Ringtone
* **Photos** app now removes the duplicate photos automatically.
* Please take a look on this App - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vygZF1pXT8">**Microsoft Hyperlapse**</a>.
* **Windows 10** is designed to be unified between devices, not just with a similar look and universal apps, but by having phone and desktop work together.

I'm just trying the **Windows Phone 10 Preview**, so I expect it to have even cooler features when it's launch, I still don't have any integration with Cortana in this Preview,
 that's something that I'm looking for.



 If you have any question / opinion please share with me :)
